# English Conversion and Feature Selection Fix Summary

## 🎯 Issues Identified

Your reported issues:
1. Greymass and others still present in Fig. 2 → feature selection not fully applied
2. Garbled text in Fig. 3 → correlation matrix failed
3. Garbled text in prediction visualization → Chinese font/encoding issue

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Feature Selection Fix**
- ✅ **Removed redundant features**: GreyMass, index, BorderVoxelCount, Elongation, Flatness, Anisotropy
- ✅ **Removed non-ellipsoid features**: ExtentMin/Max, BinMom2x/y/z, VoxelFaceArea, BaryCenter
- ✅ **Kept only core ellipsoid features**: Volume3d, EigenVal1/2/3, EigenVec1/2/3 X/Y/Z
- ✅ **Enhanced feature engineering**: Created meaningful features from core ellipsoid properties

### 2. **Correlation Matrix Fix**
- ✅ **Fixed data source**: Use original data instead of normalized_data
- ✅ **Added error handling**: Graceful fallback when correlation calculation fails
- ✅ **Feature filtering**: Only use features that exist in the data
- ✅ **Improved error messages**: Clear error reporting

### 3. **English Conversion**
- ✅ **Feature analysis tool**: All comments, logs, and method names converted to English
- ✅ **Main GUI**: All user-facing text converted to English
- ✅ **Visualization labels**: All plot titles, axis labels, and legends in English
- ✅ **Error messages**: All error messages in English

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### Feature Selection
```
Before: 31 mixed features (including redundant ones)
After: ~25 engineered features (only ellipsoid core features)
```

### Feature Analysis Results
```
🎯 Significant features (p<0.05, Cohen's d>0.2):
   - volume: d=0.XXX, p=X.XXe-XX
   - eigenvec1_max_alignment: d=0.XXX, p=X.XXe-XX
   - is_voxel_aligned: d=0.XXX, p=X.XXe-XX
   - volume_ellipsoid_ratio: d=0.XXX, p=X.XXe-XX
   - is_small_volume: d=0.XXX, p=X.XXe-XX
```

### Visualization
```
Before: Chinese characters showing as "□□□□"
After: Clear English labels and titles
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Core Features (13)
- `Volume3d (mm^3) `: Actual measured volume (AVIZO export)
- `EigenVal1`, `EigenVal2`, `EigenVal3`: Three axis lengths
- `EigenVec1X/Y/Z`, `EigenVec2X/Y/Z`, `EigenVec3X/Y/Z`: Three axis directions

### Engineered Features (~25)
**Volume features**:
- `volume`: Actual measured volume
- `volume_ellipsoid_ratio`: Volume deviation from ellipsoid
- `volume_deviation`: Logarithmic volume difference

**Shape features**:
- `elongation`, `flatness`, `sphericity`, `anisotropy`
- `lambda_diff_12`, `lambda_diff_23`, `lambda_diff_13`

**Direction features**:
- `eigenvec1/2/3_x/y/z_alignment`: Alignment with coordinate axes
- `eigenvec1/2/3_max_alignment`: Maximum alignment
- `eigenvec1/2/3_voxel_aligned`: Voxel alignment flags

**Combined features**:
- `overall_voxel_alignment`: Overall alignment score
- `is_voxel_aligned`: Overall voxel alignment flag
- `is_small_volume`, `is_very_small_volume`: Volume classification
- `is_high_elongation`, `is_high_flatness`: Shape anomaly flags

### Removed Features
**Redundant features**:
- `GreyMass (mm^3) `: Duplicate of Volume3d
- `index`: Particle index, meaningless
- `BorderVoxelCount`: Highly correlated with volume

**Calculable features**:
- `Elongation`, `Flatness`, `Anisotropy`: Can be calculated from EigenVal
- `ExtentMin/Max1/2/3`: Bounding box, not ellipsoid features
- `BinMom2x/y/z`, `BinMomxy/xz/yz`: Second moments, not ellipsoid features
- `VoxelFaceArea`: Surface area, not ellipsoid feature
- `BaryCenterX/Y/Z`: Center position, not ellipsoid feature

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Feature Analysis
- **Clean feature set**: Only ellipsoid core features + engineered features
- **No redundant features**: GreyMass, index, etc. removed
- **Meaningful features**: All features have clear physical meaning

### Visualization
- **No garbled characters**: All text in English
- **Working correlation matrix**: Proper error handling
- **Clear labels**: All plot elements in English

### Prediction Accuracy
- **Better feature quality**: Only relevant features used
- **Improved model performance**: Cleaner feature set
- **More accurate thresholds**: Based on meaningful features
